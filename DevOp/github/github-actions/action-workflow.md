# **GitHub Workflow Action**

> **Always learn by Doing, Not just by Reading**

## **ðŸŽ¯What is GibHub Action: -** _By the name we can undestand Github Action, where we perform some Actions like `push, pull`_

**GitHub Actions** `runs the commands that we write in the workflow .yml file in a virtual machine (VM)` provided by GitHub, which behaves just like a Linux terminal (whatever distro we have mentioned in yml file like ubuntu, Windows or macOS runners), GitHub **spins up a temporary Fresh virtual machine**, **clones our repo into it**, and executes those shell commands, just like we would in our terminal.

- **Common CLI Tools Pre-installed in GitHUb Action Virtual Machine: -**
  - Github Action has many pre-install tools from category `Version Control, Programming Languages & Runtimes, Package Managers, Container Tools, Cloud CLI Tools, Build Tools, System Tools & Utilities, Core Unix Tools, Network Tools, Database Tools` etc
  - we can install extra tools via apt, npm, pip, etc
