## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute to this project:

## Guidelines

To maintain a consistent structure, please follow these guidelines when adding new concepts:

- **Folder Structure:** Create a new folder for the concept at the root of the project. The folder name should be in `lowercase-with-dashes` if it's a multi-word concept.
- **Markdown File:** Inside the concept folder, create a `README.md` or a similarly named markdown file (e.g., `concept-name.md`) with a detailed explanation of the concept.
- **SVG:** Used drawio extension to create the flow chart and export that as svg.
