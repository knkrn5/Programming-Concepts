# **Network Concepts**

**what is internet.** _The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate using protocols like TCP/IP, and to use this internet data(download) or to upload data in the internet we need a pipeline to access the internet, this pipeline is given to us via ISP(SIM or wifi router), with some limited usage depending on our plan so this is called **data pack(How much data we can download or upload via their pipeline)**_

- **Ground stations**, which are connected to the global internet backbone via fiber optics.

## **IP Adresses: -** _use "ipconfig" cmd to see the details of the IP Adresses_

1. **IPv4: -**
2. **IPv6: -**

## **LocalHost vs Host**

1. LocalHost: - It is a special hostname that computers use to refer to themselves. It is a `loopback interface`, meaning that **any network traffic sent to localhost is immediately looped back to the sending machine without ever leaving the device and going out onto the physical network**. The most common IP address associated with localhost is `127.0.0.1 for IPv4` and `::1 for IPv6.`

2. Host: -
   - PAN: -
   - LAN: -
   - WAN: -

## **VPN**

## **Proxy Server**

## **MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL(MAC):-**

## **DNS**

1. **DNS over HTTPS (DoH):-**
2. **DNS over TLS (DoT):-**

## **Wi-Fi(wireless fidelity)**

- **Wireless Mediums**
