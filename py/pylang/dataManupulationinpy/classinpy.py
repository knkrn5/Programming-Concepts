# Using dot notation
# dot notation They work with class instances (i.e., objects created from classes) and not with normal Python dictionaries. Because those are the ones that have attributes. Dictionaries donâ€™t have attributes â€” they have keys, so use .get() / dict[key] for that.
print(user.name)  # â†’ "Karan"
print(user.age)  # â†’ 24

# =======Accessing attributes=======
print(getattr(user, "name", "Unknown"))  # â†’ "Karan"
print(getattr(user, "email", "Not set"))  # â†’ "Not set"

# =======Setting attributes=======
setattr(user, "email", "karan@email.com")
print(user.email)  # â†’ "karan@email.com"
