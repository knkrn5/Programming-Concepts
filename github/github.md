## **ðŸŽ¯Mono-Repo VS Poly-repo: -** _The difference is about code organization, not deployment or Hosting pattern, like whether frontend and backend are served together or separately._

1. **Mono-repo: -** _A monorepo (short for "monolithic repository") means many different services/projects **(like, Web Frontend, Mobile Frontend, Multiple backends)** codes is stored in a `single version control repository`_
   - **Mono-repo is about code organization, not deployment or Hosting pattern,** like whether frontend and backend are served together or separately
2. **Poly-repo: -** _Each project has its own `dedicated version control repository`._
